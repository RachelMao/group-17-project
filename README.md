# Group-17-Project
## Description
In a first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, we analyzed the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in zip code 10025, and calculated how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. The top10 is a pandas.Series in descending order by number of incidents, and contains as its labels the incident type and as associated values the total number of incidents of this type in 2020.

In a second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in 10025 than they are in general. The result is in the form of a single bool called `higher_parking_proportion` which is True if 10025 contains a higher proportion of parking incidents than the global value, and False otherwise.
